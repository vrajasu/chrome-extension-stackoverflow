# chrome-extension-stackoverflow

Stackoverflow is a very common term amongst all the tech people out there. But, most often than not StackOverFlow is overused  by programmers to find shortcuts to learning instead of  turning to the official documentation.

After collecting data we can try to analyze user's need for help in a particular topic.

It is assumed that copying code from Stackoverflow is OK. But in fact many large corporations have rules against that.

Here is a chrome based extension that tracks user activity on stackoverflow like clicks, scrolls, search, copy action etc. This tracker was built as a part of a class assignment in Adaptive Web.

## Features of the Chrome Extension Tracker
1. Tracking User searches inside StackOverFlow.
2. Tracking User Clicks on Tags, Upvotes, Downvotes, Bookmarks and Question Links.
3. Storing the tags and question for every question opened on StackOverFlow. Tags explored are a very good indication of the topic the user is trying to learn or solve.
4. Determining if the user scrolls or not.
5. Alerting the user in case he directly copies the code.
6. The Tracker can send data dumps to your API as needed.
7. The Tracker is only activated when  StackOverFlow is opened.
